# Smart-Grid-Demand-Response-with-Machine-Learning
Simple demand response system using machine learning to predict electricity load and respond accordingly.

Objective:

Develop a demand response system that automatically adjusts the load based on grid conditions.

Dataset:

The Electricity Load Diagrams Dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Python Libraries:

pandas - Pandas

numpy - NumPy

matplotlib.pyplot - Matplotlib

sklearn.model_selection and sklearn.preprocessing - Scikit-learn

sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression - Scikit-learn

sklearn.metrics - Scikit-learn

zipfile - (No additional library required, part of Python's standard library)

seaborn - Seaborn

statsmodels.tsa.arima.model.ARIMA - Statsmodels

prophet - Prophet

Description:

This project focuses on implementing a demand response strategy by predicting periods of high load and adjusting the grid's supply in real-time.
